# 2DoBox

This is an application that helps a user to keep track of tasks.

## Usage

This application is used to help a user keep track of their tasks. The user is able to enter the title and a description of the task, along with a priority level of either none, low, normal, high, or critical. The user has the option to mark the 'completed task' button, that will strikethrough the text on the card, change the background color, and then also hide it from view. The user has the option to show all cards and view their completed tasks. The user also has the option to fully delete the task from the application.

The tasks are searchable via an input search bar and searchable by priority level via descriptive buttons that show only tasks with that specific priority level.

All changes are made and updated in local storage and persist until manually cleared.
